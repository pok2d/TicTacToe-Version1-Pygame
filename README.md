# TicTacToe Version1
 TicTacToe game using pygame, version 1. Made by the great and allmighty pok, this is the first version of the highly unoptimized and feature missing tictactoe game.
 Right now it works with pygame creating a basic window you play in, with every click alternating between O and X (Meant to be played with 2 players at one PC).
 Things/Issues that I gotta update (For version 2):
 -Some parts could be more optimized or more compact, like the several if/elif statements for the click event system and probably other parts.
 -If someone does win, the window simply closes and in the terminal is printed who won. I think it'd be way better to have the window just stay open with some text there saying who won, and then maybe even add a restart button feature.
